<h2>Fantsy â€” Crowdsourced Fantasy Football Rankings</h2>

<h4>What is Fantsy?</h4>
<blockquote>Fantsy is an app that allows users to vote on players each week of the football season to effectively raise their trend and bring awareness to the player. Fantsy has been designed since day one to bring awareness to players who may normally fly under the radar, ideally for 12+ person leagues. The format is simple. At the end of every football week, after Monday Night Football, all of the previous weeks votes and rankings will be purged. Thus, starting late Monday night, or early Tuesday morning, users will begin voting on players and suggesting lesser known players via the <i>add player</i> feature. Once votes are cast on current and new players, the board will start to take shape again in time for waivers on Wednesday, and up until Sunday, when the board will get locked.</blockquote>
